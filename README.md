# remove_silence_from_audio
This code defines a function called remove_silence that takes two file paths as input: input_file_path, which is the path to the audio file from which the silences will be removed, and output_file_path, which is the path where the resulting audio file will be saved.

The function first loads the audio file using the AudioSegment class from the pydub library. It then calculates the average dBFS level of the audio file and sets the silence threshold to this value.

The minimum silence length is calculated based on the length of the audio file and set to 5% of its total duration. The detect_nonsilent method from the pydub.silence module is used to split the audio into non-silent parts based on the silence threshold and minimum silence length.

Finally, the function concatenates the non-silent parts of the audio that are longer than the minimum silence length using the AudioSegment.empty() method and exports the resulting audio to the specified output file path in WAV format using the export method.

Overall, this code removes silences from an audio file and saves the remaining audio to a new file.
